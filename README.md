# Atom Language Support for Cool

This is a port of the [sublime-cool-highlighter](https://github.com/princjef/sublime-cool-highlighter) repository, providing basic syntax highlighting and support for [Cool (Classroom Object Oriented Language)](http://www.cs.virginia.edu/~cs415/cool-manual/cool-manual.html) in the Atom text editor from GitHub.

These syntax highlighting rules are culled from the lexical definition of the language, but are almost certainly not bug-free. If you see an issue with something in the repository, feel free to create an issue or fork the repository and fix it yourself. Pull requests are greatly appreciated.

## Installation

To install this package, simply install the package ```language-cool``` in Atom by going to the Packages area of the preferences or entering the following command in the shell:

```bash
$ apm install language-cool
```
